# ADAS Alert Analysis

## Introduction
The ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) Alert Analysis project is centered around understanding and analyzing the various alerts generated by ADAS-equipped vehicles. ADAS systems are designed to enhance vehicle safety by alerting drivers to potential hazards and providing support in critical driving situations.

This analysis is conducted using a dataset provided by Intel India as part of the Intel Unnati Summer Grand Challenge. The dataset includes a variety of alerts generated by different vehicles under different driving conditions. By examining this data, we aim to uncover patterns in alert occurrences and identify factors that may influence these alerts, such as vehicle speed and geographical location.

## Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:

1.**Understand Alert Distribution:** 
 Analyze the frequency and distribution of different ADAS alerts across multiple vehicles to identify which types of alerts are most common.

2.**Analyze the Impact of Speed:** Investigate the relationship between vehicle speed and the occurrence of various alerts, determining whether certain alerts are more likely to occur at specific speed ranges.

3.**Geospatial Analysis:** Utilize the latitude and longitude data to map out where these alerts are occurring. This helps in understanding if there are specific locations or types of environments where certain alerts are more frequent.

4.**Visualize Data:** Develop visualizations that clearly communicate the relationships between vehicle speed, alert types, and geographical location to make the findings easily understandable.

### Dataset
The dataset includes information on multiple vehicles, each generating a series of ADAS alerts over time. 

The key columns in the dataset are:

•	**Alert:** Type of ADAS alert generated.   
•	**Date and Time:** Timestamp indicating when the alert was generated.    
•	**Latitude and Longitude:** Geographic coordinates where the alert occurred.   
•	**Vehicle:** Identifier for the vehicle that generated the alert.   
•	**Speed:** The speed of the vehicle at the time the alert was triggered.

### Significance
Analyzing ADAS alerts is crucial for improving vehicle safety and driver awareness. By understanding the conditions under which these alerts are most frequently triggered, manufacturers and researchers can enhance the effectiveness of ADAS systems, potentially reducing the risk of accidents.

Furthermore, this project provides insights that can be used to refine the algorithms that power ADAS, ensuring they are more responsive to real-world driving conditions. The analysis also contributes to broader efforts in automotive safety and intelligent transportation systems.

### Conclusion
The ADAS Alert Analysis project serves as a comprehensive examination of how advanced driver assistance systems behave in real-world scenarios. By exploring the relationships between alerts, vehicle speed, and geographic location, this project provides valuable insights that can drive future innovations in vehicle safety technology.
